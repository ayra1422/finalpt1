```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
historic <- read.csv("https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/833y-fsy8/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD")
clean<-clean_names(historic)
boroughs<-table(historic$BORO)
barplot(boroughs)
race<-table(historic$PERP_RACE)
barplot(race)
summary(historic)

```

For my project, I chose to look at a bar plot that would look at the boroughs with the most incidents and the race that of the perps.
